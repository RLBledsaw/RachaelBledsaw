	<p>Ninjas -- or more accurately ninjitsu -- was started during the Warring Period in Japan. This was a time when several warlords fought for control of the island chain from the monk controlled Emporer. It is sometimes called the Unification Period.</p>
	<p> Unchecked violence and raiding against the farmers and peasants lead them to turn to guerilla tactics to defend themselves. These tactics were then honed into the deadly, codeless, art it is today. Because of its lower class roots, ninjitsu and those who practice it have only one thing that can pass as a code: Get the job done. No method was off the table, poisoning, drowning, killing the target while he was sleeping, eating, using the privies, even making love...all were perfectly fine times to kill.</p>
	<p>After Japan had been united by Tokugawa, ninjas achieved a status of invisible visibility. They formed clans that used specific styles and tools (though no clan used nunchucks. Ever.) and obtained a grudgingly accepted Court presence in Edo because Tokugawa found them exceedingly useful. But they never really lost their motto -- such as it is -- and it remains a popular choice over bushido, which was practiced by the noble and highly trained samurai.</p>
